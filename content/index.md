#### What is VENUS?

VENUS is the acronym of our vendor-neutral [qMRLab](https://qmrlab.org) workflow that begins with the acquisition of qMRI data using [open-source & vendor-neutral pulse sequences](https://github.com/qmrlab/pulse_sequences) and follows with the post-processing using data-driven and container-mediated [qMRFLow](https://github.com/qmrlab/qmrflow) pipelines.

```

Open-source and vendor-neutral pulse sequences are developed as [RTHawk](https://www.heartvista.ai/for-research) applications, that can be run on most GE and Siemens clinical scanners.

#### NATIVE vs VENUS: Does it matter to the measurement stability? 

The purpose of this study was to test whether VENUS can improve **inter-vendor** reproducibility of `T1`, `MTR` and `MTSat` measurements across three scanners by two vendors, in phantoms and in-vivo.

To test this, we developed a vendor-neutral 3D-SPGR sequence, then compared measurement stability between scanners using VENUS and vendor-native (NATIVE) implementations.

**Toggle the tabs for details:**

```{tabbed} Scanners
* **G1** GE Discovery 750w (3T)
* **S1** Siemens Prisma (3T)
* **S2** Siemens Skyra (3T)
```

```{tabbed} NATIVE implementation
* **G1** SPGR (`DV25.0_R02_1549.b`)
* **S1** FLASH (`N4_VE11C_LATEST_20160120`)
* **S2** FLASH (`N4_VE11C_LATEST_20160120`)
```

```{tabbed} VENUS implementation
* **G1** [qMRPullseq/mt_sat](https://github.com/qMRLab/mt_sat/releases/tag/v1.0) (`v1.0` on `RTHawk v3`)
* **S1** [qMRPullseq/mt_sat](https://github.com/qMRLab/mt_sat/releases/tag/v1.0) (`v1.0` on `RTHawk v3`)
* **S2** [qMRPullseq/mt_sat](https://github.com/qMRLab/mt_sat/releases/tag/v1.0) (`v1.0` on `RTHawk v3`)
```

```{tabbed} Phantom
* [ISMRM/NIST System Phantom](https://qmri.com/contrast-mri/) (SN = 42)
```

```{tabbed} In-vivo
* 3 healthy participants volunteered for data collection.
```

#### The answer is yes!

Our results show that VENUS can **significantly** decrease inter-vendor variability of `T1`, `MTR` and `MTsat`.

`````{admonition} Implications
:class: tip
VENUS approach to qMRI has several implications for qMRI research and for the reliability of multicenter clinical trials. 

**This Jupyter Book supports that by highlighting the core idea of VENUS:**

```{epigraph}
To deliver what it promises, quantitative MRI needs to dispense with undisclosed implementation details, from scanner to publication.

#### About the data and derivatives

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DATA%20DOI-10.17605%2FOSF.IO%2F5N3CU-blue)](https://osf.io/5n3cu/)

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/BIDS_Logo.png" alt="drawing" width="220px"/>

The dataset downloaded to this Jupyter Book includes the raw data and first-order derivatives, **following the [qMRI-BIDS data standard](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.22.21265382v3)**.

All the figures and statistical analyses were based on the first-order derivatives. 

<img src="https://github.com/qMRLab/qMRFlow/raw/master/assets/qmrflow_small.png" alt="drawing" width="200px"/>


To reproduce the first-order derivatives from the raw data, you need to run `qMRFlow` pipelines using Nextflow.

```{admonition} Click the button to reveal qMRFlow instructions.
:class: dropdown
1. Install [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html)
2. Pull Docker images:
    ```shell
    docker pull qmrlab/minimal:v2.5.0b
    docker pull qmrlab/antsfsl:latest
    ```
3. Download the [dataset](https://osf.io/5n3cu/)
4. Run

* To process the phantom data:
    ```shell
    cd /to/VENUS
    nextflow run venus-process-phantom.nf --bids /set/to/bids/directory -with-report phantom-report.html
    ```

* To process the in-vivo data:
    ```shell
    cd /to/VENUS
    nextflow run venus-process-invivo.nf --bids /set/to/bids/directory -with-report invivo-report.html
    ```

**If Docker is not available**

You need to make sure that following dependencies are installed on your local machine/environment and accessible via shell (i.e. added to the system PATH):

* qMRLab v2.4.1
* ANTs 
* FSL
* MATLAB or Octave 

In the config file, set the following parameter to `false` at [this line](https://github.com/qMRLab/VENUS/blob/90df3f94aa0c07ee2a116b9ad5785b2b0057fa60/nextflow.config#L131-L133), this will enforce workflow to look for local executables.

Next, set MATLAB or Octave executable path and qMRLab directory at [this line](https://github.com/qMRLab/VENUS/blob/90df3f94aa0c07ee2a116b9ad5785b2b0057fa60/nextflow.config#L144-L148)

Finally, execute the workflows using the `nextflow run` commands above.
