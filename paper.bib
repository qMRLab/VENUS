    abstract = {Quantitative MRI (qMRI) promises better specificity, accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility relative to its clinically-used qualitative MRI counterpart. Longitudinal reproducibility is particularly important in qMRI. The goal is to reliably quantify tissue properties that may be assessed in longitudinal clinical studies throughout disease progression or during treatment. In this work, we present the initial data release of the quantitative MRI portion of the Courtois project on neural modelling (CNeuroMod), where the brain and cervical spinal cord of six participants were scanned at regular intervals over the course of several years. This first release includes 3 years of data collection and up to 10 sessions per participant using quantitative MRI imaging protocols (T1, magnetization transfer (MTR, MTsat), and diffusion). In the brain, T1MP2RAGE, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusivity (RD) all exhibited high longitudinal reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient – ICC ≃ 1 and within-subject coefficient of variations – wCV \&lt; 1\%). The spinal cord cross-sectional area (CSA) computed using T2w images and T1MTsat exhibited the best longitudinal reproducibility (ICC ≃ 1 and 0.7 respectively, and wCV 2.4\% and 6.9\%). Results from this work show the level of longitudinal reproducibility that can be expected from qMRI protocols in the brain and spinal cord in the absence of hardware and software upgrades, and could help in the design of future longitudinal clinical studies.},

abstract = {Empirical observations of how labs conduct research indicate that the adoption rate of open practices for transparent, reproducible, and collaborative science remains in its infancy. This is at odds with the overwhelming evidence for the necessity of these practices and their benefits for individual researchers, scientific progress, and society in general. To date, information required for implementing open science practices throughout the different steps of a research project is scattered among many different sources. Even experienced researchers in the topic find it hard to navigate the ecosystem of tools and to make sustainable choices. Here, we provide an integrated overview of community-developed resources that can support collaborative, open, reproducible, replicable, robust and generalizable neuroimaging throughout the entire research cycle from inception to publication and across different neuroimaging modalities. We review tools and practices supporting study inception and planning, data acquisition, research data management, data processing and analysis, and research dissemination. An online version of this resource can be found at https://oreoni.github.io. We believe it will prove helpful for researchers and institutions to make a successful and sustainable move towards open and reproducible science and to eventually take an active role in its future development.}
