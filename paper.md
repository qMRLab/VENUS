## What is VENUS?

VENUS is the acronym of our vendor-neutral [qMRLab](https://qmrlab.org) workflow that begins with the acquisition of qMRI data using [open-source & vendor-neutral pulse sequences](https://github.com/qmrlab/pulse_sequences) and follows with the post-processing using data-driven and container-mediated [qMRFLow](https://github.com/qmrlab/qmrflow) pipelines ([Figure 1](#qmrlabbanner)).

:::

Open-source and vendor-neutral pulse sequences are developed as [RTHawk](https://www.heartvista.ai/for-research) applications, that can be run on most GE and Siemens clinical scanners.



## NATIVE vs VENUS: Does it matter to the measurement stability? 

The purpose of this study was to test whether VENUS can improve **inter-vendor** reproducibility of `T1`, `MTR` and `MTSat` measurements across three scanners by two vendors, in phantoms and in-vivo.

To test this, we developed a vendor-neutral 3D-SPGR sequence, then compared measurement stability between scanners using VENUS and vendor-native (NATIVE) implementations.

## The answer is yes!

Our results show that VENUS can **significantly** decrease inter-vendor variability of `T1`, `MTR` and `MTsat`.

::::{admonition} Implications

VENUS approach to qMRI has several implications for qMRI research and for the reliability of multicenter clinical trials. 

**This Jupyter Book supports that by highlighting the core idea of VENUS:**

**If Docker is not available**

You need to make sure that following dependencies are installed on your local machine/environment and accessible via shell (i.e. added to the system PATH):

* qMRLab v2.4.1
* ANTs 
* FSL
* MATLAB or Octave 

In the config file, set the following parameter to `false` at [this line](https://github.com/qMRLab/VENUS/blob/90df3f94aa0c07ee2a116b9ad5785b2b0057fa60/nextflow.config#L131-L133), this will enforce workflow to look for local executables.

Next, set MATLAB or Octave executable path and qMRLab directory at [this line](https://github.com/qMRLab/VENUS/blob/90df3f94aa0c07ee2a116b9ad5785b2b0057fa60/nextflow.config#L144-L148)

## üßÆ Deciles and shift function

:::{admonition} Note
:class: tip
Reproduces Figure 6a from the [article](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.27.474259v2).
:::

Before moving on to the next page that performs shift function (for P3) and hierarchical shift function analyses (across participants) in `R`, this subsection provides some background information about these statistical tests.

:::{figure} assets/sf_exp.jpg
:label: sfexp

Explanation of the shift function analysis.
:::

### What is a decile? 

Deciles (a.k.a quantiles) are 1/10th of a distribution, created by splitting the distribution at 9 boundary points (excluding the min and max). For example, median is the 5th decile of a distribution.

### How do deciles create a shift function? 

To characterize differences between two distributions not only at one decile (e.g., the median), but throughout the whole range of the distributions, shift functions calculate differences at each decile. 

:::{figure} #shiftcell

Shift function example.
:::

For example, distributions `X` (green) and `Y` (red) below do not differ much at the central tendency, marked by the dashed lines. The distribution `Y` is slightly higher than `X` at the central decile. 

On the other hand, distributions `X` and `Y` differ in spread. The distribution `X` is much wider than the distribution `Y`. As a result:

* The first decile of `X` (green vertical line on the left) is smaller than that of `Y` (red vertical line on the left)
* The last decile of `X` (green vertical line on the right) is greater than that of `Y` (red vertical line on the right)

The profile of shift function calculated for **X - Y** explains how the deciles of distribution `X` should be shifted to match those of the distribution `Y`: 

* The first decile of `Y` (**D1**) must be shifted towards left (towards lower values) to match that of `X`
* The first decile of `Y` must be shifted towards right (towards higher values) to match that of `X`

Therefore, the first decile on Fig. 4 is below and the last decile is above the zero-crossing.

:::

## What about hierarchical shift functions? 

Hierarchical shift function (HSF) is an extension of the shift function analysis for the comparison of dependent distributions across multiple participants.

In our case, each between-scanner comparison comes from a repeated measurement, given that the same participants were scanned using different scanners and pulse sequence implementations.
